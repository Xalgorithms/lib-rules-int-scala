#Goal: Rearrange and match the data in the two included tables. The name data is not in order, this should map the correct name to hours of overtime worked.

REQUIRE test:overtime_worked:0.0.1 AS hours;
REQUIRE test:employee_names:0.0.1 AS names; 


#I keep gravitating towards this pattern based on xalgo.md :

#Functional:
ASSEMBLE all_info
  COLUMNS FROM table:hours
  COLUMN employee_name AS name FROM table:names; #WHEN @employee_id == table:names.employee_id;


#Non-Functional:
ASSEMBLE all_info_when
  COLUMNS FROM table:hours
  COLUMN employee_name AS name FROM table:names WHEN @employee_id == table:names.employee_id;
