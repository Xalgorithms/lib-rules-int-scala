#Rule: Overtime pay based on hours worked.
WHEN envelope:type == 'pay_request';

REQUIRE test:employee_hours:0.0.1;
REQUIRE test:employee_information:0.0.1;
REQUIRE test:employee_information_mmc:0.0.1; #Mismatched id column.

# Two different overtime pay formats:
REQUIRE test:overtime_pay_before:0.0.1;
REQUIRE test:overtime_pay_after:0.0.1;

# This test rule, "Overtime", attempts to apply an overtime pay-scale to the
# hours worked by the employees of a theoretical company. The current 
# implementation does not assume that an envelope with a single employee_id
# is present, and runs calculations for both a single user and the employee
# group.

#RULE STEPS: Multiple implementations for each.
# 1. Sort Employees
# 2. Determine pay bracket
# 3. Multiply pay by overtime multiplier

#STEP 1:

# 1.1 This runs correctly. 
ASSEMBLE employee_hours_hardcoded_filter
  COLUMNS FROM table:employee_hours WHEN employee_id == 3004
  COLUMNS FROM table:employee_information WHEN employee_id == 3004;

# 1.2 Fails. Matches the hours from employee 3001 to every other staff member.
ASSEMBLE employee_hours_hardcoded_filter_2
  COLUMNS FROM table:employee_hours WHEN employee_id == 3001 
  COLUMNS FROM table:employee_information WHEN employee_id == @employee_id;

# 1.3 This runs corectly, but relies on columns with identical data and
#     different lables. (Cannot assume that this will be the case.)
ASSEMBLE employee_hours_mismatched_column_label_filtering
  COLUMNS FROM table:employee_hours
  COLUMNS FROM table:employee_information_mmc;
FILTER table:employee_hours_mismatched_column_label_filtering
  WHEN @employee_id_mmc == @employee_id;

# 1.4 This fails to generate a table.
ASSEMBLE employee_hours_mismatched_column_label_filtering_2
  COLUMNS FROM table:employee_hours
  COLUMNS FROM table:employee_information_mmc
  WHEN employee_id_mmc == @employee_id;

#STEP 2

# 2.1 Run on hardcoded_filter table above with the single employee.
#     functional and strips the correct upper pay brackets. 
ASSEMBLE calculate_employee_pay
  COLUMNS FROM table:employee_hours_hardcoded_filter
  COLUMNS FROM table:overtime_pay_before;

#FILTER table:calculate_employee_pay
#  WHEN @hours_before > @overtime_hours;

## Need subtract() for this.
#MAP table:calculate_employee_pay
#  USING determine_bracket = @hours_before - @overtime_hours;


#Requires multiply() and to proceed with implementation.
