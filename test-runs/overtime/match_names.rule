#Goal: Rearrange and match the data in the two included tables. The name data is not in order, this should map the correct name to hours of overtime worked.

REQUIRE test:overtime_worked:0.0.1 AS hours;
REQUIRE test:employee_names:0.0.1 AS names; 
REQUIRE test:employee_names_v2:0.0.1 AS names_v2; 
REQUIRE test:overtime_pay:0.0.1 AS pay; 


#SECTION 1
#I keep gravitating towards this pattern based on xalgo.md :

#FIGURE 1-A: Functional without WHEN:
#ASSEMBLE all_info
#  COLUMNS FROM table:hours
#  COLUMN employee_name AS name FROM table:names; #WHEN @employee_id == table:names.employee_id;

#FIGURE 1-B: Non-Functional with WHEN:
#ASSEMBLE all_info_when
#  COLUMNS FROM table:hours
#  COLUMN employee_name AS name FROM table:names WHEN @employee_id == table:names.employee_id;


#SECTION 2
#If column keys in two different tables have the same name, a column will be discarded without sorting.

#FIGURE 2-A
ASSEMBLE overtime_table_A
  COLUMNS FROM table:hours
  COLUMNS FROM table:names;


#FIGURE 2-B: When tables use a different key to store the same value, filtering can occur as the column is added to the table:
ASSEMBLE overtime_table_B
  COLUMNS FROM table:hours
  COLUMNS FROM table:names_v2;

FILTER table:overtime_table_B
  WHEN @id == @employee_id;
